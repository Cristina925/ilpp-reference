> # Incident Language Protection Pack (ILPP) — Executive Edition (Reference)

This page is a neutral reference for a language-only documentation set intended for use during incidents, service disruptions, or regulatory engagement where facts are incomplete and written statements may later be relied upon as evidence.

ILPP exists to reduce downstream exposure created by premature or imprecise written statements made during unresolved incidents. It provides bounded phrasing for acknowledgement, uncertainty, procedural description, and time-bounded updates — without assigning cause, fault, responsibility, or outcome.

## What it is
- A language-only internal documentation pack for legal, compliance, risk, and executive teams
- Designed for moments when organisations must communicate before full factual clarity is available
- Structured to support consistency and restraint in written statements under scrutiny

## What it is not
- Not legal, regulatory, compliance, or professional advice
- Not a PR guide, media statement pack, crisis playbook, or implementation framework
- Does not instruct actions or recommend decisions
- Use does not guarantee acceptance by any authority
